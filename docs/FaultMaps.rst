FaultMaps and implicit checks

Motivation
==========

Code generated by managed language runtimes tend to have checks that
are required for safety but never fail in practice.  In such cases, it
is profitable to make the non-failing case cheaper even if it makes
the failing case significantly more expensive.  This asymmetry can be
exploited by folding such safety checks into operations that can be
made to fault reliably if the check would have failed, and recovering
from such a fault by using a signal handler.

For example, Java requires null checks on objects before they are read
from or written to.  If the object is ``null`` then a
``NullPointerException`` has to be thrown, interrupting normal
execution.  In practice, however, dereferencing a ``null`` pointer is
extremely rare in well-behaved Java programs, and typically the null
check can be folded into a nearby memory operation that operates on
the same memory location.

The Fault Map Section
=====================

Information about implicit checks generated by LLVM are put in a
special "fault map" section.  On Darwin this section is named
``__llvm_faultmaps``.

The format of this section is

.. code-block:: none

  Header {
    uint8  : Fault Map Version (current version is 1)
    uint8  : Reserved (expected to be 0)
    uint16 : Reserved (expected to be 0)
  }
  uint32 : NumFunctions
  FunctionInfo[NumFunctions] {
    uint64 : FunctionAddress
    uint32 : NumFaultingPCs
    uint32 : Reserved (expected to be 0)
    FunctionFaultInfo[NumFaultingPCs] {
      uint32  : FaultKind = FaultMaps::FaultingLoad (only legal value currently)
      uint32  : FaultingPCOffset
      uint32  : handlerPCOffset
    }
  }
