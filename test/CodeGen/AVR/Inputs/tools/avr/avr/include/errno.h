/** \defgroup avr_errno <errno.h>: System Errors

    Some functions in the library set the global variable \c errno when an
    error occurs. The file, \c <errno.h>, provides symbolic names for various
    error codes. 

    \warning The \c errno global variable is not safe to use in a threaded or
    multi-task system. A race condition can occur if a task is interrupted
    between the call which sets \c error and when the task examines \c
    errno. If another task changes \c errno during this time, the result will
    be incorrect for the interrupted task. */
