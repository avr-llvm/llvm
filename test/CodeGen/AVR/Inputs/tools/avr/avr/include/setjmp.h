/** \defgroup setjmp <setjmp.h>: Non-local goto

    While the C language has the dreaded \c goto statement, it can only be
    used to jump to a label in the same (local) function.  In order to jump
    directly to another (non-local) function, the C library provides the
    setjmp() and longjmp() functions.  setjmp() and longjmp() are useful for
    dealing with errors and interrupts encountered in a low-level subroutine
    of a program.

    \note setjmp() and longjmp() make programs hard to understand and maintain.
    If possible, an alternative should be used.

    \note longjmp() can destroy changes made to global register
    variables (see \ref faq_regbind).

    For a very detailed discussion of setjmp()/longjmp(), see Chapter 7 of
    <em>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</em>, by W. Richard
    Stevens.

    Example:

    \code
    #include <setjmp.h>

    jmp_buf env;

    int main (void)
    {
        if (setjmp (env))
        {
            ... handle error ...
        }

        while (1)
        {
           ... main processing loop which calls foo() some where ...
        }
    }

    ...

    void foo (void)
    {
        ... blah, blah, blah ...

        if (err)
        {
            longjmp (env, 1);
        }
    }
    \endcode */

/** \ingroup setjmp
    \brief Save stack context for non-local goto.

    \code #include <setjmp.h>\endcode

    setjmp() saves the stack context/environment in \e __jmpb for later use by
    longjmp().  The stack context will be invalidated if the function which
    called setjmp() returns.

    \param __jmpb Variable of type \c jmp_buf which holds the stack
    information such that the environment can be restored.

    \returns setjmp() returns 0 if returning directly, and
    non-zero when returning from longjmp() using the saved context. */

    \code #include <setjmp.h>\endcode

    longjmp() restores the environment saved by the last call of setjmp() with
    the corresponding \e __jmpb argument.  After longjmp() is completed,
    program execution continues as if the corresponding call of setjmp() had
    just returned the value \e __ret.

    \note longjmp() cannot cause 0 to be returned.  If longjmp() is invoked
    with a second argument of 0, 1 will be returned instead.

    \param __jmpb Information saved by a previous call to setjmp().
    \param __ret  Value to return to the caller of setjmp().

    \returns This function never returns. */
